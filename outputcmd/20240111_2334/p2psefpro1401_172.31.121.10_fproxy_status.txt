Primary selected using:
    <2024/01/11 20:36:32> FPX4HETA21000108 is selected as the primary because the value 0 of link-failure + pingsvr-failure is less than peer member FPX4HETA21000109.
    <2024/01/11 20:26:03> FPX4HETA21000109 is selected as the primary because its uptime is larger than peer member FPX4HETA21000108.
    <2024/01/11 20:19:57> FPX4HETA21000109 is selected as the primary because it's the only member in the cluster.
    <2024/01/11 20:19:51> FPX4HETA21000109 is selected as the primary because UPGRADE_SECONDARY flag is set on peer member FPX4HETA21000108.
